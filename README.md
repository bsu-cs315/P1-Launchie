## Project Report



### Reflection

Working on the third iteration of this project felt as if I was giving the game what it deserved. Finally, Launchie had a proper title screen and a more fitting game loop. I spent much of my time this iteration reading through the GDQuest conventions to identify potential pitfalls of the code I had previously written and there were many. If I had started out writing better code, implementing what I had learned from the docs would have saved a lot of time and headache. Overall, this iteration for me was focused on cleaning up and reflecting over the last two iterations.

### Self-Evaluation
- [X] D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.
- [X] D-2: The repository contains a <code>README.md</code> file in its top-level directory.
- [X] D-3: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of M or less.
- [X] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate <code>.gitignore</code> file and no unnecessary files tracked.
- [X] C-2: Your release is tagged using <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.
- [X] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] C-4: The <code>README.md</code> contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.
- [X] C-5: The project content is eligible for an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">ESRB Rating</a> of T or less.
- [X] C-6: The game starts on a title screen. Interacting with the title screen moves the player into the gameplay screen.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The playable game is published to GitHub Pages and linked from the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] B-3: Earn one star.
- [X] A-1: Earn three stars.
- [X] ⭐ When the game is over, the player can interact to take the game back to the title screen, from which the game can be played again.
- [X] ⭐ Use an <code>AnimationPlayer</code> or <code>Tween</code> to add some pop to the user-interface.
- [X] ⭐ The source code complies with our adopted style guide.
