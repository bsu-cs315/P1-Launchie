## Project Report

### Reflection

Creating the physics-based game in Godot was a great learning experience. The biggest hurdle for me in the project was reading the documentation to learn which nodes were a good fit for what I needed. For example, I needed to know how to make the cannon not be affected by physics and make the projectile be affected by physics. I created the assets for this game and really enjoyed seeing my "art" come to life. One thing I learned about Godot that I appreciate is the ability to export variables from scripts and control them in the inspector tab.
